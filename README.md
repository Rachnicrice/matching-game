 ## Project Description
 We wanted to create a game for users that allows them to enhance their memory skills. Memory plays a vital role in processing information. The memory game is a card flip and match system that implements the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which we learned throughout the Code Fellows 201 course.

## Problem Domain
At first, our problem domain seemed pretty simple. On a user's click action, we needed to reveal an image. On their second click, reveal the second image and check to see if they're a match.
